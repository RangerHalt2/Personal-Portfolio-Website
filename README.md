# Logan Baysinger Portfolio Website
All pieces developed and coded manually by Logan Baysinger. Some front end pieces were taken from lucide-react and inspiration given by online free tutorials for front end pieces. This code represents my ability to create in React JS and host and deploy my very own website.

Do not contact me selling me a website, I will ignore you. There is NEVER going to be a time I buy a website.
